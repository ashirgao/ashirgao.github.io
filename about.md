I, **Abhishek**, am a Data Scientist, currently developing intelligent data-driven applications at [OnlineSales.ai](https://www.onlinesales.ai) as well as working as a Research Assistant to Prof. D.T. Mane. I have previously interned at [Sokrati](https://www.sokrati.com) and [IBM ISL](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/) to develop applications in Computer Vision and Natural Language using cutting edge tools and techniques. 

I have obtained my B.E. degree from [Pune Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.pict.edu), a premiere institute affiliated to [Savitribai Phule Pune University](http://www.unipune.ac.in/) (previously known as "Pune University"). Over the period of this course, I have managed to fit in the aforemention interships as well as work on many interesting projects involving embedded systems , operating systems, developing web & cloud-based applications, as well as projects involving AI. Under the direction of Prof. D.T. Mane, I have built multiple **Deep Learning** solutions with real world applications. 


On the side for fun, I [run](https://www.strava.com/) (3 time marathon finisher), trek, ride ([my ride](https://royalenfield.com/motorcycles/classic-350#!black)), listen to podcasts ([my current favourite](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/)), read up other interdisciplinary research blogs and monitor multiple Github projects/Google scholar pages for ideas.

I plan to obtain a Masters degree in the immediate future. I hope to use this time to

- study linear algebra, calculus, optimization techniques, probabilistic inference etc. in a comprehensive manner to understand current data modelling and inferencing techniques
- conduct meaningful research in deep learning theory to develop model architectures capable of learning more abstract "representations" and learn "hierarchy in data"
